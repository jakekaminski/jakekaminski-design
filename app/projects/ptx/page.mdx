## Overview

PTx is a family of agtech brands that includes Precision Planting and PTx
Trimble (formerly Trimble Agriculture). The brand was formed in early 2024 to
bring a consistent experience to farmers and dealers across multiple brands.

Though they had created some preliminary brand guidelines, the PTx team needed a
comprehensive digital guidelines to help them build a consistent and
user-friendly experience across their digital products. They also needed a way
to manage and share those guidelines and design systems with their global teams.

## My Role

I was hired as a designer to help the PTx team create design guidelines that
could be used across their global digital teams. Some of my responsibilities
included:

- **ðŸ§¢ Project manager**: gathering guideline needs from each digital team,
  assigning deadlines and tasks, and collecting feedback from each team as the
  guidelines were created, all in Monday.com.
- **ðŸ’… Designer**: designing individual sections and overall layout of the
  guidelines document in Figma Slides.
- **ðŸ“š Content creator**: writing the copy for the guidelines and creating
  examples of how to use the guidelines in practice.

    **Goal:** create a comprehensive digital guidelines document that could
    - _Unify_ the PTx brand across multiple digital products.
    - _Educate_ global teams on how to use the guidelines.
    - _Maintain_ the guidelines as the brand grows.

## Process

One of the biggest challenges in creating the PTx digital guidelines was
understanding what guidelines were actually needed. To address this, I asked
teams to provide me examples of designs for various platforms and products they
had worked on. Using a Figjam whiteboard, we met together and found the common
elements that were inconsistent across those designs.

    alt="Figjam board with screenshots of different PTx team designs"
    caption="Our teams provided a lot of examples of their designs for various platforms and apps."
/>

From there, we created a list of guidelines that would help unify those elements
across all digital products. We used Figma Slides to create the document, which
allowed us to easily gather feedback on each draft version.

## Outcome

The PTx digital guidelines document was completed in late 2024 and shared with
all global teams. The document included guidelines for typography, color,
spacing, and components, as well as examples of how to use those guidelines in
practice. They are meant to be descriptive, not prescriptive â€” a way to help
teams understand the brand and how to use it, not a strict set of rules.

So far the guidelines have been well-received by the PTx teams, and they have
helped to create a more consistent and user-friendly experience across their
digital products. The guidelines are also being used as a reference for new
projects, and are being updated as the brand grows.
