## Overview

When I first started designing for Precision Planting's marketing team in 2022,
they already had a strong brand and a loyal customer base. However, their
existing website's design wasn't able to keep up with new content and the
growing number of products they offered. They were also going through a full
rebrand, and needed a design overhaul to match their new brand identity.

  **Goal:** create a new website design that could
    - _Showcase_ Precision Planting's new branding
    - _Scale_ with their growing product line
    - _Support_ the design on other digital channels.

## My Role

I was hired as a designer & developer to help the marketing team overhaul their
website. Some of my responsibilities included:

- **🧪 User research**: conducting interviews with customers and dealers to
  understand their needs and pain points.
- **💅 Design system**: creating a comprehensive digital design system of
  styles, components, and page templates in Figma and tested in Storybook.
- **👾 Development**: building the new site with Next.js and Chakra UI.
- **✏️ Content Management**: migrating to Kontent.ai headless CMS.

## Process

### User Research

The biggest pain point Precision Planting was facing was that they were no
longer a _"Planting"_-only brand. As of 2022, they offered a full suite of
products compatible with equipment used year-round. This was a significant shift
in their business model, and their website needed to reflect that.

To find the best way to present this, I did card sorting with customer and
dealers to understand how they grouped products in their minds.

    **Takeaway:** Customers and dealers grouped products first by _equipment_
    compatibility, then specific use-case categories.
</Callout>

### Design

With the new brand identity and the results of the user research in mind, I
started designing the new website. I created a comprehensive digital design
system that included:

- **Styles**: colors, typography, spacing, and other design tokens.
- **Components**: buttons, forms, cards, and other UI elements.
- **Templates**: page layouts and content structures.
- **Patterns**: design patterns for common use cases.

As with most design projects, this one went through several iterations. Initial
designs were conservative and didn't depart much from the original brand. But as
Precision's internal rebrand finalized, I started making bolder decisions with
key page elements—particularly hero sections and CTAs.

    alt="Precision Planting hero sections and CTAs"
    caption="The new hero sections and CTAs have a bolder, high-contrast look."
/>

It was much easier to make decisions and get better feedback on the design's
"atomic" elements once I had these keystone components in place. I could test
everything in context of the most prominent page elements. Nailing down the rest
of the design system was a breeze from there.

    alt="Precision Planting button and link designs"
    caption="Buttons and links were designed to fit into primary page elements."
/>

<Callout>
    **Takeaway:** Sometimes it pays to start with big elements first and work
    your way down, rather than try to first build out a robust atomic system.
</Callout>

### Development

Once the design system was in place, I started building the new website. I used
Next.js and Chakra UI to create a fast, responsive, and accessible site. I also
migrated the content to Kontent.ai, a headless CMS that allowed Precision to
manage content in a more flexible and scalable way.

All UI components were developed and tested in Storybook, which made frontend
development incredibly fast and easy. Also, using a headless CMS meant that
creating new features and widgets in the CMS took _minutes_ instead of months.

    **Takeaway:** Using a headless CMS and Storybook made development much
    faster and easier. It's also allowed Precision to manage content in a more
    flexible and scalable way.

## Results

The new website was launched in late 2023, and the response has been
overwhelmingly positive. Some of the key results in the first three months
include:

- **🚦 Increased traffic**: The new website has seen a 58% increase in new users
  launch and 57% increase in pageviews.
- **👋 Improved engagement**: Bounce rate has decreased by 9% and tracked events
  (clicks, form submissions, etc.) have increased by 46%.
- **🏎️ Better performance**: The site speed and accessibility scores have
  improved significantly, with a Lighthouse score of 100% in all categories.
- **💻 Efficient development**: The new design system and headless CMS have made
  development much faster and easier, allowing Precision to launch new features
  and content in a matter of days versus months.
