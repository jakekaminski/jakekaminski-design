## Overview

Radicle Agronomics is a groundbreaking (pun-intended) agtech brand that has
created the world's first fully-automated soil sampling lab. In early 2024,
however, they had a problem: they had launched their product publicly without a
public-facing website. They needed a website that could showcase their product
and services, educate potential customers on the benefits of their technology,
and provide a way for customers to contact them.

## Process

### Content Strategy

The first step in the process was to create a content strategy that would guide
the design and development of the website. We worked with Radicle Agronomics'
marketing team to identify the key messages they wanted to convey, the target
audience they wanted to reach, and the actions they wanted visitors to take on
the site.

In most projects, I wait to start high-fidelity design until the content is
ready. However, in this case, I started designing the website in parallel with
content creation. This allowed us to iterate on the design and content
simultaneously, which helped us create a more cohesive and effective website.

### Design System

Once we had a clear content strategy in place, I began designing the website. I
created a comprehensive design system in Figma that included styles, components,
and page templates. The design system was based on Radicle Agronomics' existing
brand guidelines and was designed to be flexible and scalable as the brand grew.

### Development

With the design system in place, we began developing the website. We used
Next.js and Chakra UI to build the site, which allowed us to create a fast,
responsive, and accessible website that would work well on all devices. We also
integrated the site with Kontent.ai headless CMS and HubSpot CRM ensure that
leads generated through the site were captured and tracked.

## Outcome

After several rounds of testing and feedback, we launched the website in
early 2024. The site was well-received by Radicle Agronomics' customers and
partners, and has helped the company generate new leads and grow their business.

The Radicle Agronomics website has been a huge success for the brand. It has
helped them showcase their groundbreaking technology, educate potential
customers on the benefits of their technology, and generate new leads. The
website has also helped Radicle Agronomics establish themselves as a leader in
the precision agriculture industry and has set them up for future growth.
