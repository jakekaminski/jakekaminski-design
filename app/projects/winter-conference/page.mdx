## Logo Animation

<video
    controls
    className="h-auto w-full"
    poster="images/wc25-logo-thumbnail"
    autoPlay
    loop
    muted
>
    <source src="/videos/wc25-logo-animation.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

This was a fun project to work on! The logo animation was used as a splash
screen between sessions for Precision Planting's Winter Conference. The event is
held annually and is their biggest event of the year.

The animation was created using Adobe After Effects and exported as a video
file. The video was then embedded into the website using HTML5 video tags. The
animation was a hit with attendees and helped to set the tone for the event.

## Lower Thirds

    <source src="/videos/wc25-lower-thirds.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

In addition to the logo animation, I also created lower thirds for the event.
These lower thirds were used to introduce speakers and provide additional
information during the event. The lower thirds were created using Adobe After
Effects and exported as video files. They were then layered on top of the live
video feed during the event.

## Landing Page

The landing page for the event was designed to be simple and easy to navigate.
It featured an event registration map, a list of speakers & schedule of events,
and FAQs. The landing page was built using NextJS and Chakra UI.
